I remember the days I used to read the printed material. I loved reading so much that I used to print entire volumes of books from my home printer and read them while traveling. But they are quite inconvinient to carry. So I switched to ereading. The best thing is that I dont have to pay for ink and paper. And I can carry entire library with me where ever I go. In this blog I am reveaing my favourite tools used for reading.
