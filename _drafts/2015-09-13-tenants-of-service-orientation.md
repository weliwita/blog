Don Box who is one of the four designers of SOAP proposed the Four tenants of SOA in 2004. It is still applicable to the distributed applications and microservice architecture.

They are:
<ol>
	<li>Boundaries are Explicit</li>
	<li>Services are Autonomous</li>
	<li>Services share Schema and Contract, not Class</li>
	<li>Compatibility is based upon Policy</li>
</ol>
