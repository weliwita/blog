In the Buddhist tradition, the five hindrances (pañca nīvaraṇāni) are identified as mental factors that hinder progress in meditation and in our daily activities. I find my self they are equally applicable to the task of programming or anything that need huge amount of concentration.

## Sensory desire (kāmacchanda)
seeking for pleasure through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling. 

solution: meditation - kamachanda prahana, raga prahana


## Ill-will (vyāpāda; also spelled byāpāda)
feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness.

solution: meditation - vyapada prahana bhavanava, mithree bhavanava

## Sloth-and-torpor (thīna-middha) 
half-hearted action with little or no effort or concentration. auto pilot mode. laziness, lack of motivation.

solution: [good sleep, exersises, sun light]. promote veerya(read stories), have target daily, long term. 

## Restlessness-and-worry (uddhacca-kukkucca)
the inability to calm the mind and focus one's energy. You have lot of stuff in your plate. your mind lose focus constantly because of emails, calls, messages, 

solution: meditation. sampajana, promote samadhi than veeraya, toomuch veeraya cause this.
achieve flow state(samadhi), not too high or not too low.(goldilocks)


## Doubt (vicikiccha)
lack of conviction or trust in one's abilities. In programming world this is also known as imposter syndrome.

promote learning and knowledge.  when you try without knowing
