Considerations when deciding on architecture of your project
<ul>
	<li>Amount of data - Whether this is a big data project, database scalability, just simple CRUD</li>
	<li>Performance - performnce and scalability requirements of the project</li>
	<li>Business logic complexity - enterprice software usually has high business logic complexity</li>
	<li>Technical complexity - Whether project involves creating algorithms or embedded systems</li>
</ul>
Depending on above considerations architecture could be drastically different.
