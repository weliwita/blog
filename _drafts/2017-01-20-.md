It is quite **annoying that when we gain more and more experience in the industry we tend to forget the basics. The main reason is that we are looking for more and more abstractions, frameworks and libraries that hide the core essence of a solution to a given problem. I recently decided to reduce time spending looking for better abstractions and get back to the basics. A quick search on google directed me to the MIT open course introduction to the algorithms which I found quite interesting to **brush up my basics.
<h2>What is peak finding?</h2>
<h3>One-dimensional Version</h3>
Position 2 is a peak if and only if b ≥ a and b ≥ c. Position 9 is a peak if i ≥ h.
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i |

Figure 1: a-i are numbers
Problem: Find a peak if it exists (Does it always exist?)
<h3>Peak finding algorithms</h3>
1. Brute force
2. Divide and conquer
